# So What Is It?
A supervised learning problem where the dependent variable is categorical in nature while the independent variable(s) can be *continuous and/or categorical*. 
	- Recall that a *continuous variable* is a variable that can take on an infinite number distinct values.
# Types
## Binary
$y_i$ can take on *exactly two* possible outcomes.
$g(x_i) \approx y_i$
- $x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, ..., x_{i,n})$  - is a single vector with values from $x_{i1}$ to $x_{i,n}$ 
- $y_i \in {0,1}$ - the possible outcomes(classes)
## Multiclass (Non-Binary)
$y_i$ can take on *3 or more* possible outcomes.
$g(x_i) \approx y_i$
- $x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, ..., x_{i,n})$  - is a single vector with values from $x_{i1}$ to $x_{i,n}$ 
- $y_i \in {0,1}$ - the possible outcomes(classes)
# Terms
## Categorical Variable



### General Model Function
**$g(X) = y$**
- $g$ = model
- $X$ = feature matrix
- $y$ = target vector
